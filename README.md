# MovieBrowserDemo

Created a custom uitableviewcell class  SearchMovieCell to implement the custom UI for movie cells.

Used Appleâ€™s API URLSession for talking to the endpoints and to handle requests and responses. Used swift closures with completion handlers to pass the response object.

Used struct over class wherever I felt like I can.

Used storyboard for auto layout and to support multiple device screens.

Made sure that auto constraint errors and build warnings are fixed.
